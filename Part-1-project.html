        <h1>Part One Design Project</h1>
        
        <h2>What is the idea that you have for your app?</h2>
        <p> 
            I would love to create a space for university and college students to be abkle to come together and create an information database to inform fellow students, incoming highschoolers and people new to campus. 
            Students would be able to select their campus on the webpage, and find posts from fellow students at their university sharing their personal tips and information that have gained as students. 
            The idea is to have information about good study areas, information on residence buildings and dorms, as well as people sharing their favorite food places!
        </p>
        
        <h2>What part is 2D and what part is 3D?</h2>
        <p> The aspects of my app that will be 2D will be the basic webpage with text and titles. 
            I plan on using 3D to maybe add some depth to my photos or to create shadows with a combination of the transform properties!  </p>
        
        <h2>What is your original, simple, hypothesis about this app?</h2>
        <p> My hypothesis is that current student and prospective students will be able to use this database of information to help nagvigate student life and help feel more comfortable on campus!</p>
        <h2>Why is this idea important or needed in the world?</h2>
        <p> Personally, I moved to UVic for school from Edmonton, Alberta and I felt quite lost on campus my first semester. I would have loved to have some information about how to nagivate my first few weeks on campus or to even have an idea of what my residence building experience was going to look like before I had moved in!</p>
        <h2>How do you plan to use XR emotionally to immerse the user in the experience?</h2>
        <p> If I was able to create an XR experience for my web application I would love to create visual walkthrough of campus and dorm buildings so prospective students would be able to have a better visual idea of what their campus would look like without having to visit it in person. This way people could physically experience different parts of a prospective campus to help them make their decison. I would make this possible by adding audio features when able so that people could feel as emersed in the visuals as possible. Adding in different setting to allow users to move about the visual XR tour would allow them to have an interactive experience that could also strongly elevate the experience. </p>
        <h2>List 3 reasons why this idea is or is not good for XR.</h2>
        <p> This idea is good for XR in terms of being able to create a great visual experience for users so that they could have their questions answered visually. This would allow our users to post their tips and tricks and information and be able to link them to a certain place around campus. XR users would be able to read the posts from their fellow students and also be able to visually view the part of campus they are talking about. It would also be good as it allows the interactive aspect of a visual tour, giving users much more control over what they would like to see. Lastly, using XR would be a way to simulate a daily university experience that could be completely immersive and help students imagine what it would be like to truly attend the university.  </p>
        <h2>List 3 reasons why this idea is or is not better in 3D.</h2>
        <p> I think that my idea would be great in 3D as a lot of elemets could be enhanced. Similarly to the improvements made by XR, having 3D pictures or models of different areas on campuses could allow users to visually connet with the information they are reading. </p>
        <h2>In what way is each of AR, MR and VR possibly useful for the project?</h2>
       <p> AR stands for augmented realit, and for my project I think it could possibly be useful when visit certain campuses that in the AR as you tour around the university you could be linked to peoples posts and comments about that certain area of campus. As for MR we could have a mix of the actual campus when touring that could be combined with a simulation of what it would be like with other students around and simulated people for you to interact with. Lastly, for VR I think having simulated tours of the univeristy or even a interactive aspect where prospective students could try a simulated day in the life of a university student on that campus. </p>
        <h2>Auditing your idea  (page 61)</h2>
        
        <h2>Does your idea exist in 2D?</h2>
        My idea partially does exisit in 2D when I think about the places that people would be able to post information that their peers and prospective students are able to look at. 
        <h2>Does your idea exist in 3D?</h2>
        My idea also partially exists in 3D when I think about the possibility of including 3D visuals to add another layer to the posts made by students. These 3D elements would allow users to have more interaction with the webpage and also feel more enaged with the 2D elements. 
        <h2>What could you do in your project in 3D that you can't do in 2D?</h2>
        The visuals are the main part of my project that I would love to add a 3D element to. Being able to add 3D tours and photos can really bring depth to the webpage that cannot be done in 2D. 
        <h2>Add some of these design principles to your hypothesis (page 88)</h2>
        
           <p> My hope for my application is that it will be very user friendly with an easy to nagivate webpage that self explanitory and offers the user a quick and efficient experience. As a university studen myself I hope that I am able to design my application to be desirable to people who were in my position as a prospective university student and are in my position currently as a uvic student. By having the interactive features I hope that when posting information for their peers that students would find the information to be valuable because it is from someone that they are able to relate to. In the future prototyping process I would be looking to add more accessible features such as more languages to ensure that my website is for all. </p>
